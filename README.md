## Getting Started

Look in the [issues](https://github.com/UCMercedACM/Chapter-Website/issues) tab of this repository and look for an issue you'd like to work on
(make sure the nobody else is working on the issue unless you want to work with another person) and make a pull request along with that issue. You can also look at the project board
to see what issues and PRs are being tracked and what should be worked on. **If you commit to working on an issue
or feature, please stay committed to it and actually get it done**.
