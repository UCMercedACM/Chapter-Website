## Getting Started
Look in the [issues](https://github.com/UCMercedACM/Chapter-Website/issues) tab of this repository and look for an issue you'd like to work on
(make sure the nobody else is working on the issue unless you want to work with another person) and make a pull request along with that issue.
Don't know how to do this? keep on reading below.

## Quick Setup
Make sure you have the following:  
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) .... p.s. **v12.19.0** is a safe option, but really recommended to install [**nvm**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)  
[Yarn Classic](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)  
Run "npm i" then "npm start" (You will need your own Firebase Key, if you need the main key contact Sal#1867 or nayr#8772 on discord)

## New to coding?
If you don’t have much experience with JavaScript (which we will use for the backend) you can look into 
working on front end (which is easier to learn) the front-end is in the languages html and css so you can 
first start by learning html and css and to learn these 2 languages I’d recommend watching this video: https://youtu.be/mU6anWqZJcc

* Fork the this repository
(If you're not planning on committing to the repository you can just clone the main repo and skip first the next step (including this one))
  * How to fork:
    * click on “Fork” on the top right
* Then git clone that repository you just forked to your computer
  * How to clone:
    * Go to your terminal
    * CD into your desired location to clone the repository
    * Type in the command “git clone [link to your forked repository]” and press enter
      * e.g: “git clone https://github.com/ryanlee68/Chapter-Website”
* Make sure you're in the react branch (Most likely you'll be in the right branch)
  * How to switch branches:
    * First, make sure that you're CD'd into the forked repository
    * Use the command “git checkout origin/react” in your terminal and press enter
* CD into .\react\acm-chapter-website\
* Then, type in “npm i” in terminal and press enter
* About Firebase
  * You will need a Firebase key to run the server and connect to the database
    * There are two options to go about this
      * You can either make your own Firebase instance and use your own key
      * Or you can contact Sal#1867 or nayr#8772 on discord to get ACM's firebase key
* Run the development website/server
  * How to run the development server:
    * Type in "npm start" in your terminal and press enter
      * Again, make sure you're in the correct folder (forked-repository\react\acm-chapter-website\)
* **Code!**
* Your last commit’s comment to this forked repository should include fixed and the issue number e.g: “fixed #123”
* Once you’ve fixed/finished the issue, make a pull request to the main repository https://github.com/UCMercedACM/Chapter-Website/pulls
